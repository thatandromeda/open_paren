<p>Open paren is a podcast about libraries, librarians, and code.</p>

<p>Whether you’re just setting out to learn to code, or architecting systems in widespread use, I want to have conversations that matter to you. Let’s talk about what you do and why: how code you write makes things better for you and your patrons; your biggest successes and most interesting mistakes; where your projects have been and where they’re going; social issues that feed into, and spring out of,  library software.</p>

<p>The title, Open paren, is a play on the xkcd <a href="https://xkcd.com/312/">With Apologies to Robert Frost</a>, which ends a comparison of two programming languages by picking sides, saying</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>should we write it all again<br />
I’d end it with <br />
a close-paren.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’m happy with whatever language or toolchain gets things done for you. Let’s start something.</p>
