<h3>In this episode</h3>

<p>We talk about ending up in programming without a CS degree, informal learning and hidden prerequisites, using programming in your life, Code Club, teaching yourself and others to code, and Whitni's unbelievably freaking cool app that uses echolocation to help you evaluate whether your library spaces are acoustically well-suited to their functions.</p>

The echolocation app is like this:
