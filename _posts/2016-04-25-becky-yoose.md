Today, I'm chatting with Becky Yoose, Library Applications And Systems Manager at [The Seattle Public Library](www.spl.org). She's also active in a variety of librarian communities, including [code4lib](http://code4lib.org/), [LibTechWomen](http://libtechwomen.org/), [Troublesome Catalogers and Magical Metadata Fairies](https://www.facebook.com/groups/161813927168408/), and [mashcat](http://www.mashcat.info/), plus the documentation writers' group [Write The Docs](http://www.writethedocs.org/) . She has a hat.
