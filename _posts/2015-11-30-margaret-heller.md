Today, I'm chatting with Margaret Heller, a Digital Services Librarian at [Loyola University Chicago](http://libraries.luc.edu/). She also writes for the always-useful [ACRL TechConnect blog](http://acrl.ala.org/techconnect/), is active in [LITA](http://www.lita.org) and [Code4Lib](http://code4lib.org/), and a board member of the [Read/Write Library Chicago](http://readwritelibrary.org/).

### In this episode

We talk about the awesomely DIY Read/Write Library of Chicago (which is eager for your volunteer involvement, Chicagolanders); building a culture of UX testing; useful web analytics tools (and their privacy implications); and the pros and cons of open source library tech stacks.

Also we thank good sysadmins for making the world a better place. (Do you have good sysadmins in your life? Go give them a hug or buy them some coffee or a beer. Every day your technology isn't on fire is a day that's better because of your sysadmin. They'll probably bail you out when the tech _is_ on fire, too.)
